# COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL Queries

This repository contains SQL queries and actions conducted on COVID-19 death and vaccination data sourced from [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze COVID-19 statistics, including deaths, infections, vaccinations, and population data using SQL queries. The following queries among others were executed to derive insights from the dataset:

## Queries Performed

### 1. Total Cases vs. Total Deaths

- Query to retrieve the total number of cases compared to the total number of deaths.

### 2. Countries with Highest Infection Rates

- Query to identify countries with the highest rate of infection.

### 3. Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

- Query to find countries with the highest death count per population.

### 4. Breakdown by Continents

- Queries to break down statistics by continents.

### 5. Breakdown by Locations

- Queries to break down statistics by specific locations.

### 6. Global Numbers

- Query to obtain global statistics.

### 7. Joining COVID Death and Vaccination Tables

- Query to join the COVID death and vaccination tables together.

### 8. Total Population to Vaccination Ratio

- Query to calculate the ratio of total population to vaccination.

### 9. Changing Order Using Common Table Expression (CTE)

- Query using Common Table Expression (CTE) to change the order from 1, 2 to 2, 3.

### 10. Including Percentage of Vaccinated

- Queries to include the percentage of the vaccinated population



-The queries were done  using `SELECT`, `FROM`, `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and other SQL clauses.

## Visualization

Visualization of the obtained results was accomplished using Tableau to illustrate:

- Global statistics
- Percentage of infected population per country
- Total death count per continent
- Percentage of population infected

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joyceoluwasegun/covid-data-sql.git
    ```
2. Run the SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment, ensuring access to the COVID death and vaccination data.

Feel free to explore the SQL queries and adapt them to your specific dataset or environment.
